In case of changing the product, the vending machine has the 5th touch sensor for resetting the choice, by pressing on it the user will be redirected to the beginning “page” of choosing the product. Then, the card is read by Proximity sensors - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - HC-SR04 by reading the distance of the card’s  placement.
